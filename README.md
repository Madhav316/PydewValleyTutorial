# PydewValleyTutorial

I am making a game and this is one of the tutorials that I have to do, in order to learn some of the fundamentals to make the game. I have followed the tutorial online and was able to make the game. I still have to figure out how to commit the entire graphics folder. 

if you want too see the progress of the game or read a bit about that, follow my project - Rampant; I write blogs on it whenever I am working on it
